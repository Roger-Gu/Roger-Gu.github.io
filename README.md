# My Website

This is the repository for my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages. The site contains my blog posts and course notes.
1. 观林书苑：碎碎念
2. Course notes: Don't directly copy form them for your assignments and/or tests.

## Structure
- `_posts/`: Contains all blog posts
- `courses/`: Contains course notes pages
- `assets/`: Contains images and other media files

## How to Use
1. Add blog posts as markdown files in the `_posts/` directory with the filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Add course notes as markdown files in the `courses/` directory
3. Add images and other media to the `assets/` directory
